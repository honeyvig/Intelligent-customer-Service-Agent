--------------
To implement an intelligent customer service agent using Vapi AI, GoHighLevel, and Make.com (or similar API integration software), the following Python code outlines how to approach building and deploying the system for lead nurturing, integrating tools like Google Calendar, and sending SMS/WhatsApp/email notifications. This solution is conceptual and will require further customization based on specific API details, authentication mechanisms, and use cases.
Steps:

    Vapi AI Integration: Creating an AI-powered agent for lead nurturing with multi-path conversations.
    Google Calendar Integration: Use the Google Calendar API to schedule appointments.
    GoHighLevel Integration: Using GoHighLevel API for CRM management, customer data, and workflow automation.
    SMS/WhatsApp/Email Integration: Sending notifications using APIs like Twilio (for SMS and WhatsApp) and an email service provider like SendGrid or SMTP.

Here's how you can set up the automation:
Prerequisites:

    Python 3.x
    Libraries: requests, twilio, google-api-python-client, google-auth, sendgrid
    API Keys for Vapi AI, Google Calendar, GoHighLevel, Twilio, and SendGrid (or equivalent).

Python Code Example:

import requests
from twilio.rest import Client
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
import sendgrid
from sendgrid.helpers.mail import Mail, Email, To, Content

# Vapi AI Endpoint and API Key (Example, replace with actual details)

# GoHighLevel API setup (replace with your actual details)
GOHIGHLEVEL_API_URL = "https://api.gohighlevel.com/v1/leads"
GOHIGHLEVEL_API_KEY = "your_gohighlevel_api_key"

# Twilio setup for SMS and WhatsApp
TWILIO_PHONE = 'your_twilio_phone_number'
TWILIO_SID = 'your_twilio_sid'
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = 'your_twilio_auth_token'

# SendGrid setup for Email (if using SendGrid)
SENDGRID_API_KEY = 'your_sendgrid_api_key'

    sg.client.mail.send.post(request_body=mail.get())
    print(f"Email sent to {to}: {subject}")

# Google Calendar integration to schedule an appointment
def schedule_appointment(summary, start_time, end_time, calendar_id='primary'):
    creds = None
    if creds and creds.valid:
        creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_info(creds)
    if not creds or not creds.valid:
        if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:
            creds.refresh(Request())
        else:
            flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(
                'credentials.json', SCOPES)
            creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)
        with open('token.json', 'w') as token:
            token.write(creds.to_json())

    service = build('calendar', 'v3', credentials=creds)

        },
        'attendees': [
            {'email': 'example@example.com'},
        ],
    }

    event = service.events().insert(calendarId=calendar_id, body=event).execute()
    print(f"Appointment scheduled: {event['summary']} at {start_time}")

# Function to integrate with GoHighLevel and add leads
def add_lead_to_gohighlevel(lead_data):
    headers = {'Authorization': f"Bearer {GOHIGHLEVEL_API_KEY}"}
    response = requests.post(GOHIGHLEVEL_API_URL, json=lead_data, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print(f"Lead added to GoHighLevel: {response.json()}")
    else:
        print(f"Error adding lead to GoHighLevel: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")

def run_vapi_ai_agent(user_input):

    payload = {"input": user_input}
    response = requests.post(VAPI_AI_API_URL, json=payload, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        ai_response = response.json()
        return ai_response.get("response", "Sorry, I didn't understand.")
    else:
        print(f"Error communicating with Vapi AI: {response.status_code}")
        return "There was an issue with the conversation."

# Function to handle multi-path conversation for AI agent
def lead_nurturing_conversation(user_input):
    # Example conversation paths based on user input
    if "appointment" in user_input.lower():
        # If the user mentions appointment, schedule one
        send_sms(user_input, "We are scheduling your appointment now...")
        schedule_appointment("Consultation Appointment", "2023-11-21T09:00:00", "2023-11-21T10:00:00")
    elif "follow-up" in user_input.lower():
        # Send follow-up message to user
        send_whatsapp(user_input, "Thank you for your follow-up! We'll reach out soon.")
    else:
        # General lead nurturing path, use AI to respond
        response = run_vapi_ai_agent(user_input)
        print(response)
        return response

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example user input for lead nurturing
    user_input = "I want to book an appointment"

    # Trigger lead nurturing process
    lead_nurturing_conversation(user_input)

    # Example adding lead to GoHighLevel CRM
    lead_data = {
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com",
        "phone": "+1234567890"
    }
    add_lead_to_gohighlevel(lead_data)

Breakdown of the Code:

    Twilio for SMS/WhatsApp:
        The send_sms and send_whatsapp functions use the Twilio API to send SMS and WhatsApp messages. These can be used to follow up with leads or send appointment reminders.

    SendGrid for Email:
        The send_email function uses the SendGrid API to send transactional emails. You can customize this function for different email templates based on lead nurturing.

    Google Calendar:
        The schedule_appointment function integrates with Google Calendar to create an event (e.g., appointment) for the lead. You need to authenticate using OAuth 2.0 credentials and set up Google Calendar API.

    GoHighLevel CRM:
        The add_lead_to_gohighlevel function sends the lead data (e.g., name, email, phone) to GoHighLevel via their API.

    Vapi AI:
        The run_vapi_ai_agent function uses Vapi AI to process the user input and generate intelligent responses. You can expand the logic based on different lead stages or queries.

    Lead Nurturing Process:
        The lead_nurturing_conversation function integrates the entire process based on the user's input. It handles multiple conversation paths (e.g., appointment scheduling, follow-up, general nurturing).

Final Notes:

    Make sure to replace the placeholder API keys (VAPI_API_KEY, TWILIO_SID, SENDGRID_API_KEY, etc.) with your actual credentials.
    This is a basic implementation and should be expanded with error handling, more sophisticated workflows, and deeper integrations with GoHighLevel and other CRM platforms as needed.
